# Aux Labs

Welcome to Aux Labs! Complimentary beakers and companion
cubes are available in the gift shop.

The Aux Laboratory is a place for experimentation. Here you will find novel
solutions for problems in the Aux world. These experiments are not intended
to be used by anyone yet due to their highly unstable nature. However, we
have decided to publish them here together so that members of the community
may collaborate.

> **Note**: This repository is a part of Aux's early ad-hoc structure. In the
> future we will be moving to a standardized Aux Enhancement Proposal (AEP)
> format.

## Experiment Phases

| Phase     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Idea      | An idea exists to solve a problem we currently have with Aux. Send a pull request to this repository creating a new directory for your experiment. The directory should contain a `README.md` file explaining the purpose of the experiment.                                   |
| Iteration | Work on the experiment is done to solve for unknowns and come up with a good solution for the original problem. It may also be helpful to collaborate with others for feedback.                                                                                                |
| Proposal  | The experiment has been satisfactorily completed and is ready to be considered for official adoption by the project. Discussion with the relevant Special Interest Group should take place to handle the transition of the project out of the lab and into its own repository. |
| Adoption  | The experiment has been adopted and is now a part of Aux! The experiment should be moved to its own repository and the original experiment directory should be deleted.                                                                                                        |
